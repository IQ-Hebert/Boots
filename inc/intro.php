			<h1>IQ - Bootstrap - V5 - 12/15/2017</h1>
			<p><large>The purpose of this bootstrap is to provide a highly configurable and customizable responsive HTML5 skeleton layout. It will also contain some JavaScript and CSS3 based effects to enhance user experience. All effects are optional and can be fully striped from the bootstrap.</large></p>
			<p><large>To use this bootstrap you must have knowledge of HTML5,CSS3,SASS and JQuery. If you do not, please don't bother trying to use this as support will be near non-existence. <strong>This bootstrap is not a turn key option, and requires you to customize it. Do not use if you have a limited imagination or bad problem solving skills.</strong></large></p>
			<p><large>Please use a different bootstrap, <a href="#/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>, if you get overwhelmed, confused, or mad.</large></p>
